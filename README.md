# data-structure-year2
This is my Data Structure &amp; Algorithms Class in KMUTT CPE RC year 2. 
You can following and learning how to code ADT and another sort of things.
Hopefully it will help everyone understand Data Strucutre with Python more.

P.S. In my opinion, Python is not a good Language to study Data Structure. But I have to learn it in the University.
